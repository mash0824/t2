              You also agree that we may contact you at any time with updates and/or any other information that we may deem appropriate for you

            <p>
              We may also provide your information to third-party companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples

              analysis. The agents performing these limited functions on our behalf shall have access to our Users’ personal information as needed

            </p>
            <p>
              We will also use your personal information with your permission, for customer service, to provide you with information that you may
              request, to customize your experience with the Site Offerings and/or to contact you when necessary in connection with your use of the
              Site Offerings. We may also use your personal information for internal business purposes, such as analyzing and managing our service
              offerings including, without limitation, the Site Offerings. We may also combine the information we have gathered about you with
              information from other sources.
            </p>
            <p>
              By submitting your personal information by and through the Site Offerings, and thereby providing your permission, you agree that
              such act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR §310 et seq.), as
              amended from time to time (the "Rule") and applicable state do-not-call regulations. As such, notwithstanding that your telephone
              number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call List, and/or on applicable state do-not-call lists, we retain
              the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the Rule and applicable state do-not-call regulations.

              ("TCPA"), you consent to receive telephone calls from Company and/or its designated Third-Party Service Provider(s), including
              artificial voice calls, pre-recorded messages and/or calls (including SMS text messages) delivered via automated technology, to
              the telephone number(s) that you provided. Please note that you are not required to provide this consent in order to obtain access
              to the Site Offerings, and your consent simply allows Company and its designated Third-Party Service Providers, as applicable, to
              contact you via these means.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please be advised that by agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you are obligated to immediately inform us if and when the telephone

              reassigned to another person or entity; (ii) give up your telephone number so that it is no longer used by you; (iii) port your
              telephone number to a landline or vice versa; or (iv) otherwise stop using that telephone number for any reason (collectively

              to challenge the subpoena, prior to disclosure of any personal information pursuant to a subpoena; or (C) if we are sold, merge
              with a third-party, are acquired or are the subject of bankruptcy proceedings; provided, however, that if Company is involved in
              a bankruptcy proceeding, merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a
              prominent notice on the Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices that you
              may have regarding your personal information.
            </p>
            <p>
              You hereby consent to the disclosure of any record or communication to any third-party when we, in our sole discretion,
              determine the disclosure to be appropriate including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with third-parties

            <h2>Deleting, Modifying and Updating Your Information</h2>
            <p>
              At your request, we will: (a) inform you of what personal information we have on file for you; (b) amend the personal

              themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and,
              to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or
              systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others or would be extremely impractical
              (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).

              Please be further advised that, after you delete your personal information, residual copies may take a period of time
              before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.
