                    <h4>General</h4>
                    <p>BestRateReferrals.com and other sites owned and operated by Best Rate Holdings, LLC dba Best Rate Referrals (the "Site") are websites owned and operated by Best Rate Referrals, a Delaware State limited liability company. Best Rate Referrals provides administrative and marketplace services by matching consumers who are prospective borrowers with one or more banks and/or lenders (each a "Lender") that offer products and/or services of interest to consumers.</p>

                    <p>Best Rate Referrals is not a Lender and does not: originate, make or refinance loans; make credit decisions in connection with loans; issue loan commitments or lock-in agreements; or guarantee that submission of information on the Site will result in the origination or refinancing of a loan from a Lender. You are under no obligation to use the Site or Best Rate Referrals to begin any financing process. In order to be matched with Lender(s), Best Rate Referrals may require you to submit certain personal and financial information. Your responses, and the information you choose to submit in order to be matched with prospective Lender(s), will help improve the accuracy of the results that you obtain. You understand, acknowledge and agree that the information that you choose to provide to Best Rate Referrals will be collected, stored and transmitted only to Best Rate Referrals’™ partners, and solely for the purpose of matching you with Lenders that can provide you with more information about their respective products and/or services. Best Rate Referrals reserves the right to refuse to accept and/or use the information that you provide if such acceptance and/or use would constitute a violation of applicable law or the Best Rate Referrals Website Terms and Conditions.</p>

                    <p>The information that you submit to Best Rate Referrals is not a loan application, but instead is a request to receive conditional loan offers from Lenders. One or more Lenders may require you to complete a full application before they will extend an unconditional loan offer. Lenders may require you to pay an application or other fee and/or costs for an appraisal, credit report or other items. The Lenders will determine any such fee amount(s) and should provide you with information regarding your ability to seek a refund for any such fee(s). Make sure to compare rates and fees, as they can vary between Lenders and may depend on the state in which you reside.</p>

                    <p>Best Rate Referrals does not charge you any fee for its services, but instead receives its compensation from Lenders for the products and services that Best Rate Referrals provides. Best Rate Referrals’™ compensation varies by product and service type. Marketing fees paid by the Lender may be included in your loan rate, points and/or term.</p>

                    <h4>Federal Disclosures</h4>
                    <p>The information that you submit via the Site may be forwarded to one or more Lenders, which should disclose certain information to you pursuant to the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and other applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations. Such Lender disclosures should include: a Loan Estimate providing important details about the costs and risks associated with your loan offer; certain booklets prepared by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; notice of your right to free copies of all appraisals and other written valuations performed on your home; notice of whether or not the servicing of your loan may be transferred to another Lender while the loan is outstanding; and, if applicable, a Closing Disclosure to ensure that your loan details are correct before your scheduled closing date.</p>

                    <p>The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act ("ECOA") prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of their race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (provided that the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract), because they receive income from a public assistance program or because they may have exercised their rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The agency that administers compliance with this law varies by Lender depending on its lending authority, but may include the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces the ECOA. To file a complaint or get free information on consumer issues, visit www.ftc.gov or call toll-free at 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357); TTY: 1-866-653-4261.</p>

                    <p>While the foregoing requirements are mandatory for Lenders, Best Rate Referrals makes no representations as to the adequacy of any Lender’s compliance practices.</p>
